We want you to feel that we are a safe pair of hands. We have won many awards since we were founded almost a century ago in 1919.<br><br>

What we are most proud of is the positive feedback from our students and customers: 98% of City Lit students rate us as excellent, very good or good - it's why so many of our students come back to City Lit year after year.<br><br>
